# Auto Weather Change
##### Made in partnership with [@Legendkiller21](https://github.com/Legendkiller21)

This submod will map the weather in MAS according to the location you're at.

## How to install:
1. Open the zip file from the release

2. Copy the `game/` folder inside the zip to the `DDLC/` folder (the folder with the DDLC exe in it) and **MERGE** the folders

## How to set *Auto Atmos Change* up:
1. Head over to [open weather network](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) and generate an api key for their **"Current Weather Data"** API
(Don't worry, they're free)

2. Copy the key that gets generated and paste it into the API keys page in the escape menu for MAS

3. If the key is valid and accepted, Monika should soon ask you about getting your location, enter your **city name** and she'll do her best to get the right one. If there's more than one city by that name, don't worry, she'll have you confirm which one is yours.

4. After a few minutes, the weather in MAS should start looking a little closer to what you're seeing outside!

This submod is compatible with the [Submod Updater Plugin](https://github.com/Booplicate/MAS-Submods-SubmodUpdaterPlugin/releases/latest)! Give it an install to make updating this submod easier.

## FaQ:
#### I need to change my location!
- No worries! you can change your location can be changed easily by going to:
    1. Hey, Monika...
    2. You
    3. [player]'s location

    Once there, you'll be able to give Monika your new location
